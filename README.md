Welcome to the Brainwave Matrix Internship repository. This repository contains the tasks completed during the internship, showcasing various projects and exercises, including an interactive ATM interface developed in Python.
Repository Contents
ATM Interface
An interactive ATM system implemented in Python, allowing users to perform realistic banking operations. This system includes the following features:
PIN Management:
Create a new 4-digit PIN.
Validate PIN for security.
Change PIN after validation.
Account Operations:
Check account balance.
Deposit funds.
Withdraw funds (with sufficient balance).
User Interaction:
Menu-driven system for seamless navigation.
PIN validation with a limit of three attempts.
Key Highlights:
The ATM interface is built with user-friendliness in mind.
Proper error handling ensures the system is secure and robust.
Each feature is thoroughly commented for ease of understanding and maintainability.
How to Run the ATM Interface
Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Brainwave_Matrix_Internship.git
Navigate to the Directory
cd Brainwave_Matrix_Internship
Run the Script
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
python atm_interface.py
Follow the On-Screen Instructions
Create a 4-digit PIN if itâ€™s your first time using the system.
Enter your PIN to access the menu options.
Perform desired operations such as balance checks, deposits, withdrawals, and PIN changes.
Code Highlights
The code for the ATM interface is modular and beginner-friendly. It demonstrates the following concepts:Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
Use of classes, methods, and attributes to structure the program.
Validation:Input validation for PIN creation and numeric inputs.
Error Handling:Proper handling of invalid inputs.
Security Features:Limited attempts for PIN validation.
Contribution Guidelines: Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to suggest improvements or report issues, please create a pull request or an issue in this repository.
